##General Ideas and Thoughts

###All about git
First off there are multiple steps

0. `git add` <-- This tells git you care about this new file and that git should "stage" the files. This sets up a pending staging area, and only things in staging get commited on the next step. (basically its saying things just added are going to be made pulic, i.e. on deck) 
0. `git commit` <-- This command tell git that what you just staged (using add) will apply perminatly to everybody (only local level)
0. `git push` <-- This now syncs your local server changes onto the git hub server
0. `git pull` <-- This syncs/pulls any changes that the server has for you. Updates you to the latest version from what your teammates have `commited` and `pushed`

Any other thoughts please add!
